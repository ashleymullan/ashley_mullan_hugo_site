üëã Hi, and welcome to my website! I'm **Ashley**, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I recently earned my master's degree from the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://stats.wfu.edu/) at Wake Forest University, where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Lotspeich](https://www.sarahlotspeich.com/) on methods to handle measurement error and their exciting applications to the study of local food access. I üíñ working with data and talking about sitcoms and romcoms, sometimes even [at the same time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRwA-At8TQ853uAKEudn6Ol84eFd4LJp/view?usp=sharing)!
