summary: Genre is a fluid descriptor used to categorize musical works. Historically, it has been assigned manually due to the challenge of the task. Representatives of a particular genre may share characteristics related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, or pitch content of the music. It is of interest to automatically classify music files in a way that aids music information retrieval. Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and random forests, have shown remarkable efficiency in classifying music genres. In this project, we created a novel dataset that contains 100 music files spanning 4 musical genres. After extracting sound features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Spectral Centroid, and Zero Crossing Rate from the time series representation of a music file as well as two musical attributes essential to music theory, time signature and key signature, we trained a two-layered convolutional neural network to classify genre. In addition, we used a random forest to evaluate the effectiveness of each feature. The details of this study and the results will be presented in the poster.
